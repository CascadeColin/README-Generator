## Description

This application makes it easy to write README files!  It accepts user data and automatically formats it into a professional looking README with a license badge directly under the title.  After that, there is a table of contents with links to "Description", "Installation", "Usage", "Contributing", "Tests", "License", and "Questions".  There is also an automatically included "Appendix" giving me (Colin Marshall) credit for the application.  

The "License" section, this application currently accepts:  MIT License, ISC License, GNU General Public License v3.0, and Mozilla Public License 2.0.  This also includes a link to the text of each license, along with a dynamically created GitHub username and copyright year.

The "Questions" section includes a dynamically created link to your GitHub profile page.  It also formats a line under that in which users can contact the software developer directly by the specified email address.
